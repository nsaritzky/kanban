## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - State management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For CSS
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) - For building forms

### Continued development

The drag 'n drop across columns still isn't working quite right, and that's something I'd like to fix.
